# Theme rotation

Homedeck supports manual theme selection with an automatic hourly rotation. The UI theme picker
lets you choose a theme immediately; on the next hour boundary the app advances to the next
theme in the rotation order. The selection and last-rotation hour are stored in local storage so
the dashboard stays consistent across refreshes.

## Included themes

The following themes are available:

1. Nightfox
2. Gruvbox
3. Rosé Pine
4. Tokyo Night
5. Catppuccin Mocha
6. Dracula

## Rotation order

The automatic rotation follows the list above, advancing once each hour. If you pick a theme
manually, the rotation will resume on the next hour.
